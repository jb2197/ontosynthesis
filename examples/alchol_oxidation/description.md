# Procedure

1. set up the benchtop with
    1. required chemicals
    2. required hardware units
2. sequential solid dispense
    1. Desired amount of solid R1 is added to the reactor
    2. Desired amount of solid R2 is added to the reactor
    3. Desired amount of solid R3 is added to the reactor
3. sequential liquid dispense
    1. 0.5 mL of liquid S1 is added to the reactor
    2. 0.5 mL of liquid S2 is added to the reactor
4. start stirring at 500 rpm at room temperature
5. Wait 24 hours

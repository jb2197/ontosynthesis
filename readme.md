# Ontosynthesis

Semantic tools for organic synthesis execution.

## Objectives
Given an organic reaction recipe and an experiment platform:
1. identify the necessary specifications (knowledge gap), if any, needed 
to execute this reaction on this platform
2. a dynamic knowledge graph describing the state of this platform (simulator)
3. semantic rules/restrictions for error detection


## Dependencies
- owlready2: `pip install git+https://bitbucket.org/jibalamy/owlready2/`
- betterproto: `pip install betterproto==2.0.0b5`

Synthesis Operation Ontology
---

Synthesis Operation Ontology (SOO) is a domain ontology developed for common operations used in organic synthesis. The applications of this ontology include
1. To accurately represent synthesis procedures;
2. To identify differences between syntheses performed on different hardware platforms;
3. To facilitate interoperation, such as performing the same synthesis procedure on different hardware platforms;
4. To help troubleshooting procedures by reasoning over operation effects.
